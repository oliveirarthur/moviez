# moviez

App (still) in development by [Arthur Oliveira](https://github.com/oliveirarthur/) as a test for API consuming with Ionic 2.

This app uses [YTS](http://yts.ag)'s API to show and search movies, and download them using torrent files.

Did you find any problem? Please, go to the contact tab in the app and tell me what happened ;)
